                <h2 class="post__title">Javascript understanding scope</h2>
                <p class="post__description">To efficiently program in javascript you will have to understand the principle of scope. The javascript scope is the set of variables you have access to, this goes for both objects and functions since in javascript functions and objects are also variables. To better understand scope we will have to look into how javascript is being executed. By taking a look at the compiler, engine and the scope.</p>

                <p class="post__description">When you&#39;re building a web application it is important to be able to control the service lifetime of the registrations in your container. The reason is that some of your objects might require being instantiated on every request while another instance should be unique and should only be instantiated once in the application lifespan.</p>

                <h2 class="post__title">Hoisting in JavaScript</h2>
                <p class="post__description">In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used. In other words, a variable can be used before it has been declared, this is called hoisting. The term hoisting cannot be found in the official JavaScript documents, but the term was invented as a general way of thinking about what happens in the compilation phase when variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope. To be exact the variables are not being moved to the top of the scope, but they&#39;re being stored in memory doing the compile phase, so they can be used in the execution phase.</p>

                <h2 class="post__title">What is &#39;this&#39; in JavaScript</h2>
                <p class="post__description">In a language like C# &#39;this&#39; always points to the containing class, so going into JavaScript you might think that &#39;this&#39; always points to the containing function, but this is not the case. Sometimes you will find &#39;this&#39; actually pointing to the function, but other times you will find it pointing to the global object or to something third. In this post, I will go through the rules of how the &#39;this&#39; binding is being set, so hopefully, development in JavaScript using the &#39;this&#39; keyword will get easier and less confusing.</p>

                <p class="post__description">A lot of developers today write their styles in a transpiled language like Sass or Less. Creating a setup is needed to transpile, bundle and minify the code. In this post I will show you how to setup a build flow with Webpack 2, to transpile, bundle, minify and add vendor specific CSS to the final bundle.</p>
